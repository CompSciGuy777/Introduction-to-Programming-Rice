Introduction to Programming




# Rice-Rocks
This is my final project from a Python Games class on Coursera.  I took this class from MAR14-MAY14.  This is the code for my final project, an Astoriods clone.  You can go and play the game here: http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user33_F5xt5chVgb79uWU.py  This demonstates a working knowledge of classes, Object Orientied Programming skills, a working knowledge of Python, and ability to integrate with frameworks.
